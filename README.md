# UdacityProject_SimplyMusic
This was a project during my Udacity Android Development Beginner Nanodegree. We were required to create an interface for a music application, implementing multiple activities and explicit intents. We were also required to use TextViews on each screen to suggest how it will be used and potential applications to do it.
